## Tips for Better Results

<Tip>
**Use natural language** - The semantic search understands context, so "looking for a leadership role in technology" works as well as "CTO position".
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Combine filters** - More specific filters lead to more relevant results. Don't hesitate to use multiple criteria.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Check market data first** - Use `available_*` tools to see what values are valid for filters before searching.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Mind the limit** - Default is 20 results, max is 100. For broader searches, use pagination with `offset`.
</Warning>
