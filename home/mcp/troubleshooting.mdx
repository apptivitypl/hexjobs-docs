**Solutions:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check Server URL">
    Ensure you're using the correct endpoint:
    ```
    https://mcp.hexjobs.com/mcp
    ```
    
    Common mistakes:
    - Missing `https://`
    - Typo in domain name

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Verify Configuration">

      "mcpServers": {
        "hexjobs": {
          "url": "https://mcp.hexjobs.com/mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Tools Not Available

**Symptoms:**
- MCP server connects but tools don't appear
- Assistant says "I don't have access to job search tools"

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify Connection Status**
   - Check if MCP server shows as connected in your client
   - Look for green indicator or "connected" status

2. **Restart Client**
   - Completely quit and restart your AI assistant
   - Wait for MCP initialization

3. **Check Logs**
   - Claude Desktop: Look for errors in dev console
   - LM Studio: Check MCP server logs
   - Cursor: Check output panel

4. **Reinstall Configuration**
   - Remove server from config
   - Save file
   - Re-add server configuration
   - Restart client

---

## Search Issues

### No Results Found

**Symptoms:**
- Search returns empty results
- `"total": 0` in response

**Solutions:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Broaden Your Query">
    Try less specific search terms:
    - Instead of "Senior Python Django Developer", try "Python Developer"
    - Remove very specific requirements
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Filters">
    Verify your filters aren't too restrictive:
    - Remove salary filters temporarily
    - Try without city filter
    - Remove experience level filter
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Market Data Tools">
    Check what's available:
    ```
    What job categories are available?
    How many jobs in Poland?
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Try Different Region">
    Job availability varies by country:
    - Poland (PL) has most offers
    - Germany (DE) has many offers
    - Austria (AT) has fewer offers
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

### Unexpected Results

**Symptoms:**
- Results don't match your query
- Irrelevant job offers returned

**Solutions:**

1. **Be More Specific**
   ```
   ❌ "Find jobs"
   ✅ "Find Python developer jobs in Warsaw"
   ```

2. **Use Filters**
   ```
   ❌ "IT jobs"
   ✅ "IT jobs in Poland, senior level, remote work"
   ```

3. **Check Spelling**
   - City names: "Warszawa" not "Warsaw" for Polish listings
   - Category names: Use exact names from `available_categories`

4. **Understand Semantic Search**
   - Search finds similar terms automatically
   - "CTO" also finds "Chief Technology Officer", "Technical Director"
   - This is a feature, not a bug!

## Configuration Problems

### Claude Desktop Not Loading Config

**Symptoms:**
- Changes to config file don't take effect
- Old configuration still active

**Solutions:**

<CodeGroup>

```bash macOS
# 1. Quit Claude completely
killall Claude

# 2. Verify config file location
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

# 3. Check JSON syntax
python3 -m json.tool ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

# 4. Restart Claude
open -a Claude
```

```powershell Windows
# 1. Quit Claude completely (Task Manager)

# 2. Verify config file
type "%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json"

# 3. Check JSON syntax (in PowerShell)
Get-Content "$env:APPDATA\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json" | ConvertFrom-Json

# 4. Restart Claude
```

</CodeGroup>

---

### JSON Syntax Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Config file not parsed
- Client won't start

**Common Mistakes:**

<CodeGroup>

```json ❌ Missing Comma
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hexjobs": {
      "url": "https://mcp.hexjobs.com/mcp"
    }  // Missing comma if more entries follow
    "other": {
      "url": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

```json ❌ Trailing Comma
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hexjobs": {
      "url": "https://mcp.hexjobs.com/mcp",
    }, // Trailing comma not allowed
  }
}
```

```json ✅ Correct
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hexjobs": {
      "url": "https://mcp.hexjobs.com/mcp"
    },
    "other": {
      "url": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

**Validation:**
Use online JSON validator or command-line tool to check syntax.

## Performance Issues

### Slow Responses

**Symptoms:**
- Searches take long time
- Timeouts occur

**Solutions:**

1. **Reduce Result Set**
   - Use smaller `limit` (default is 20)
   - Add more specific filters
   - Narrow down search criteria

2. **Check Internet Speed**
   - Test connection to server
   - Try on different network

3. **Simplify Query**
   - Avoid very complex multi-filter searches
   - Break into multiple simpler queries

---

### Rate Limiting

**Symptoms:**
- "Too many requests" errors
- Temporary blocks

**Solutions:**

<Warning>
Hexjobs MCP uses fair-use rate limiting. Avoid:
- Rapid-fire automated requests
- Bulk data scraping
- Concurrent multiple clients with same config
</Warning>

**Best Practices:**
- Add delays between automated requests
- Use pagination instead of multiple searches
- Cache results when possible
- Use `offers_count` before fetching full data

---

## Data Issues

### Missing Data Fields

**Symptoms:**
- Some job offers missing salary info
- No company logo
- Incomplete descriptions

**Explanation:**

Not all job postings include complete information:
- Salary: Many companies don't publish salary ranges
- Logos: Some companies don't provide logos
- Descriptions: Quality varies by source

This is expected behavior, not a bug.

---

### Outdated Listings

**Symptoms:**
- Old job postings returned
- Expired positions

**Note:**

The MCP server filters out expired offers automatically. If you see old listings:
1. They may still be active
2. Company hasn't set expiration date
3. Position may be evergreen (always hiring)

To report outdated listing: [contact@hexjobs.com](mailto:contact@hexjobs.com)

## Client-Specific Issues

### LM Studio

**Problem:** Button doesn't work

**Solution:**
- Ensure LM Studio is up to date
- Try manual configuration instead
- Check LM Studio MCP documentation

---

### ChatGPT Desktop

**Problem:** Config file location unclear

**Solution:**
Create directory if it doesn't exist:

```bash macOS
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/OpenAI/ChatGPT
```

```powershell Windows
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:APPDATA\OpenAI\ChatGPT"
```

---

### Cursor

**Problem:** MCP settings not visible

**Solution:**
1. Update Cursor to latest version
2. Enable Features → Model Context Protocol in settings
3. Restart Cursor

---

### Cline

**Problem:** Server shows as disconnected

**Solution:**
1. Check Cline extension is latest version
2. Reload VS Code window
3. Check VS Code output panel for errors
